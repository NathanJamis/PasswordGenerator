# Password Generator

## Application Description:
---
This repository uses Javascript to allow users to generate a secure password by selecting the following criteria:
* Password length of between 8 and 128 characters
* Use of lowercase letters
* Use of uppercase letters
* Use of numbers
* Use of symbols

### Functionality
---
When the user presses the "Generate Password" button they will be given the 5 criteria alerts.

Once the user confirms their passwords criteria, the randomized password will be displayed in the text area.

However, if the user either sets a length outside of the 8-128 character parameters, the text area will display a message to the user to set a password length within the 8-128 character range.

Also, if the user does not confirm any set of criteria, a message will display in the text area to instruct the user to set at least one criteria option.
